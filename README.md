Welcome to the `streamlit-openai` package! This package provides a Streamlit 
component for creating chat interfaces using OpenAIâ€™s API. It supports both 
the Chat Completions and Assistants APIs, and also includes integration with 
OpenAIâ€™s built-in tools, such as function calling and file search.

# Installation

```sh
$ pip install streamlit-openai streamlit openai
```

# Usage

Export your OpenAI API key:

```sh
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```

Save the following code to `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    # Use Chat Completions API
    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.ChatCompletions()

    # Alternatively, use Assistants API
    # st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.Assistants()

st.session_state.chat.run()
```

Run the app:

```sh
$ streamlit run app.py
```

# Schematic Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the `Container` and `Block` classes used
to create a chat interface:

# Chat Completions API

The `ChatCompletions` class is a wrapper around OpenAIâ€™s Chat Completions API,
which allows you to create a chat interface with a single assistant. The
`ChatCompletions` class provides a simple interface for sending messages to
the assistant and receiving responses. It also supports OpenAIâ€™s built-in
tools, such as file input and function calling.

## File Inputs

The `ChatCompletions` class allows you to upload files and use them as context 
for the assistant. Currently, the only supported file type is PDF files.

One way to provide file inputs is to use the `message_files` parameter when
initializing the `ChatCompletions` class. Below is an example of how to
upload a PDF file and use it as context for the assistant:

```python
import streamlit as st
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.ChatCompletions(
        message_files=["example.pdf"]
    )

st.session_state.chat.run()
```

Alternatively, you can use the `st.file_uploader` method to allow users to
upload files dynamically. Below is an example of how to use the `st.file_uploader`
method to upload a PDF file and use it as context for the assistant:

```python
import streamlit as st
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.ChatCompletions()
    
uploaded_files = st.sidebar.file_uploader("Upload Files", accept_multiple_files=True)

st.session_state.chat.run(uploaded_files=uploaded_files)
```

## Function Calling

You can define and call custom functions within a chat using OpenAIâ€™s function 
calling capabilities. To create a custom function, define a `CustomFunction` 
class that takes two input arguments: `definition` (a dictionary describing 
the function) and `function` (the actual callable method). Below is an example 
of a custom function that generates an image based on a given prompt:

```python
import streamlit as st
import openai
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    definition = {
        "name": "generate_image",
        "description": "Generate an image based on a given prompt.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "prompt": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "A description of the image to be generated.",
                }
            },
            "required": ["prompt"]
        }
    }

    def function(prompt):
        client = openai.OpenAI()
        response = client.images.generate(
            model="dall-e-3",
            prompt=prompt,
            size="1024x1024",
            quality="standard",
            n=1,
        )
        return response.data[0].url
    
    generate_image = streamlit_openai.utils.CustomFunction(definition, function)

    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.ChatCompletions(
        functions=[generate_image],
    )

st.session_state.chat.run()
```

# Assistants API

The `Assistants` class is a wrapper around OpenAIâ€™s Assistants API, which 
allows you to create and manage assistants that can perform various tasks. The
`Assistants` class provides a simple interface for creating, updating, and
retrieving assistants, as well as managing their state and context.

## Function Calling

You can define and call custom functions within a chat using OpenAIâ€™s function 
calling capabilities. To create a custom function, define a `CustomFunction` 
class that takes two input arguments: `definition` (a dictionary describing 
the function) and `function` (the actual callable method). Below is an example 
of a custom function that generates an image based on a given prompt:

```python
import streamlit as st
import openai
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    definition = {
        "name": "generate_image",
        "description": "Generate an image based on a given prompt.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "prompt": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "A description of the image to be generated.",
                }
            },
            "required": ["prompt"]
        }
    }

    def function(prompt):
        client = openai.OpenAI()
        response = client.images.generate(
            model="dall-e-3",
            prompt=prompt,
            size="1024x1024",
            quality="standard",
            n=1,
        )
        return response.data[0].url
    
    generate_image = streamlit_openai.utils.CustomFunction(definition, function)

    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.Assistants(
        functions=[generate_image],
    )

st.session_state.chat.run()
```

## File Search

You can allow models to search your files for relevant information before 
generating a response by using OpenAIâ€™s file search capabilities. To enable 
file search, set the `file_search` parameter to `True` when initializing the 
`Assistants` class. Note that this feature is available only in the Assistants 
API and not in the Chat Completions API from OpenAI. Below is an example of
how to enable file search in a chat interface:

```python
import streamlit as st
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.Assistants(file_search=True)
    
uploaded_files = st.sidebar.file_uploader("Upload Files", accept_multiple_files=True)

st.session_state.chat.run(uploaded_files=uploaded_files)
```

## Code Interpreter

You can allow models to run Python code in a sandboxed execution environment 
using OpenAIâ€™s code interpreter capabilities. To enable code interpreter, set 
the `code_interpreter` parameter to `True` when initializing the `Assistants` 
class. Note that this feature is available only in the Assistants API and not 
in the Chat Completions API from OpenAI. Below is an example of how to enable 
code interpreter in a chat interface:

```python
import streamlit as st
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.Assistants(code_interpreter=True)

st.session_state.chat.run()
```

## Existing Assistant Retrieval
You can retrieve an existing assistant by providing its ID when initializing
the `Assistants` class. This allows you to continue a conversation with an
existing assistant without losing context. Below is an example of how to
retrieve an existing assistant in a chat interface:

```python
import streamlit as st
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.Assistants(assistant_id="asst_...")
    
st.session_state.chat.run()
```

# Customization

## Avatar Image
You can customize the avatar images for the assistant and user in the chat interface
by providing the `assistant_avatar` and `user_avatar` parameters when initializing
the `ChatCompletions` or `Assistants` class. Below is an example of how to
customize the avatar images in a chat interface:

```python
import streamlit as st
import streamlit_openai

if "chat" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chat = streamlit_openai.ChatCompletions(assistant_avatar="ðŸ¦–")

st.session_state.chat.run()
```
